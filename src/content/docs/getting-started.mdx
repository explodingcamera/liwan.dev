Liwan is a lightweight analytics tool that respects your users' privacy. This guide will help you get started setting up Liwan on your server.

# Quick Start

<Tabs syncKey="docker">
  <TabItem icon="rocket" label="Binary">
    
    Liwan is distributed as a single, self-contained binary. You can grab the latest release for your platform
    from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/explodingcamera/liwan/releases/latest).

    <Tabs syncKey="os">
    <TabItem  label="Linux">
    ```sh
    # Download the latest release
    curl -JLO 'https://github.com/explodingcamera/liwan/releases/latest/download/liwan-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz'

    # Ensure the ~/.local/bin directory exists (You might need to add it to your PATH)
    mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

    # Extract the binary
    tar -xzf liwan-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz -C ~/.local/bin liwan

    # Make the binary executable
    chmod +x ~/.local/bin/liwan
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="macOS">
     ```sh
    # Download the latest release
    curl -JLO 'https://github.com/explodingcamera/liwan/releases/latest/download/liwan-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz'

    # Ensure the ~/.local/bin directory exists (You might need to add it to your PATH)
    mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

    # Extract the binary
    tar -xzf liwan-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz -C ~/.local/bin liwan

    # Make the binary executable
    chmod +x ~/.local/bin/liwan
    ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Now, you can either run the binary directly (using `liwan`) or install it as a service so that it starts automatically when your server boots.

    Depending on your operating system, you can use `systemd`, `launchd`, or `rc.d` to manage the service. For more information, see the [Running Liwan as a Service](/guides/service) guide.

    Liwan will start and bind to port 8080 on localhost. To make Liwan accessible from the internet, you will need to set up a reverse proxy. For more information, see the [Setting up a Reverse Proxy](/guides/reverse-proxy) guide.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem icon="seti:docker" label="Docker">
  
    To install Liwan using Docker, run the following command:

    ```sh
    docker run -d --name liwan \
          # Bind Liwan to port 8080 on localhost
          # This might be different depending on your setup
          -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080
          # Store the data in a Docker volume
          -v liwan-data:/liwan-data \
          # The URL where Liwan will be reachable from
          -e LIWAN_BASE_URL=https://a.example.com \
          ghcr.io/explodingcamera/liwan:latest
    ```

    This will start Liwan and bind it to port 8080 on localhost. To make Liwan accessible from the internet, you will need to set up a reverse proxy. For more information, see the [Setting up a Reverse Proxy](/guides/reverse-proxy) guide.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem icon="seti:docker" label="Docker Compose">
  
    To download and install Liwan using Docker Compose, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

    ```yaml
    # docker-compose.yml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
      liwan:
        image: ghcr.io/explodingcamera/liwan:latest
        container_name: liwan
        ports:
          - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
        volumes:
          - liwan-data:/liwan-data
        # See https://liwan.dev/reference/configuration for all configuration options
        environment:
          - LIWAN_BASE_URL=https://a.example.com

    volumes:
      liwan-data:
    ```

    Then run the following command:

    ```sh
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    This will start Liwan and bind it to port 8080 on localhost. To make Liwan accessible from the internet, you will need to set up a reverse proxy. For more information, see the [Setting up a Reverse Proxy](/guides/reverse-proxy) guide.

  </TabItem>
  {/* <TabItem icon="seti:docker" label="Docker Compose (with Caddy)">
  
    To install Liwan using Docker Compose with Caddy as a reverse proxy, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:
    ```yaml
    # docker-compose.yml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
      caddy:
        image: caddy:latest
        container_name: caddy
        ports:
          - "80:80"
          - "443:443"
        networks:
          - liwan_caddy_network
        volumes:
          - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
          - caddy_data:/data
          - caddy_config:/config

      liwan:
        image: ghcr.io/explodingcamera/liwan:latest
        container_name: liwan
        expose:
          - "8080"
        networks:
          - liwan_caddy_network
        volumes:
          - liwan-data:/liwan-data
        # See https://liwan.dev/reference/configuration for all configuration options
        environment:
          - LIWAN_BASE_URL=https://a.example.com

    volumes:
      liwan-data:
      caddy_data:
      caddy_config:

    networks:
      caddy_liwan_network:
        driver: bridge
    ```

    And create a `Caddyfile` that looks something like this:

    ```Caddyfile
    # Caddyfile
    a.example.com {
      reverse_proxy liwan:8080
      tls you@example.com
    }
    ```

    Then run the following command:

    ```sh
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    For more information on setting up Caddy, see the [Setting up a Reverse Proxy](/guides/reverse-proxy) guide.

# Next Steps

Once you've started Liwan, check the logs to find the link to the setup page. Here, you can create your first
user account and set up your first project and entity to start collecting data.

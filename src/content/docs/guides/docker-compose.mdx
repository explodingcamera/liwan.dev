title: Setup using Docker Compose
---

To download and install Liwan using Docker Compose, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.8"

services:
  liwan:
  image: ghcr.io/explodingcamera/liwan:latest
  container_name: liwan
  ports:
    - "127.0.0.1:9042:9042"
  volumes:
    - liwan-data:/liwan-data
  # See https://liwan.dev/reference/configuration for all configuration options
  environment:
    - LIWAN_BASE_URL=https://a.example.com

volumes:
  liwan-data:
```

Then run the following command:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

This will start Liwan and bind it to port 9042 on localhost. To make Liwan accessible from the internet, you will need to set up a reverse proxy. For more information, see the [Setting up a Reverse Proxy](/guides/reverse-proxy) guide.

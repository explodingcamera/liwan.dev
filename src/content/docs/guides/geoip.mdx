title: GeoIP Lookup
---

Liwan can optionally perform a GeoIP lookup on the visitor's IP address to determine their country and city.
To enable this feature, you need to provide Liwan with a MaxMind account ID and license key.
Alternatively, you can specify a path to a local GeoIP database file in the MaxMind DB format (see the [Configuration Reference](/reference/configuration) for more information).

Keep in mind that this will require extra resources and may impact the performance of Liwan, especially on low-end hardware.

## Creating a MaxMind Account

For Country and City lookups, the free offering from MaxMind is sufficient. You can sign up for a free account on the [MaxMind website](https://www.maxmind.com/geoip/signup).
Once you have created an account, you can go to the [Manage License Keys](https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/current/license-key) page to generate a license key and find your account ID.

## Example Configuration

To enable GeoIP lookups, add the following configuration to your `liwan.config.toml` file:

```toml
# liwan.config.toml
[geoip]
maxmind_account_id="MY_ACCOUNT_ID"
maxmind_license_key="MY_LICENSE_KEY"
maxmind_edition="GeoLite2-City"
```

Replace `MY_ACCOUNT_ID` and `MY_LICENSE_KEY` with your MaxMind account ID and license key, respectively.

The next time you start Liwan, it will automatically download the GeoIP database and use it to perform lookups.
To ensure that the database is kept up to date and accurate, Liwan will periodically check for updates and download the latest version.

If you prefer to use a local GeoIP database file, you can specify the path to the file in the configuration:

```toml
# liwan.config.toml
[geoip]
maxmind_db_path="/path/to/GeoLite2-City.mmdb"
```

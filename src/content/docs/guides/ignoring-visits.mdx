title: Ignoring Visits
---

Currently, Liwan does not support ignoring visits based on specific criteria. By default, Liwan
will ignore visits from known bots and crawlers and connections from `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`.

However, you can disable the tracking of visits from your own browser by adding `disable-liwan` to your browser's local storage:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('disable-liwan', 'true');
```

This will only prevent Liwan from tracking your own visits and will not affect other users.

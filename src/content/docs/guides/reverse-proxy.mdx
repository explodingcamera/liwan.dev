title: Setting up a Reverse Proxy
---

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

When exposing Liwan to the public internet, it is recommended to use a reverse proxy to handle SSL termination and other security-related tasks. This guide will show you how to set up a reverse proxy using Caddy.

There are many other reverse proxies available, such as [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) ([guide](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion)), [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) ([guide](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/install-traefik/)), and [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) ([guide](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy-and-let-s-encrypt)), which all vary in complexity and features.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

- A domain name pointing to your server's IP address
- Liwan running on a server accessible from the internet

<Steps>

1.  Install Caddy

    First, install Caddy on your server. You can download the latest version from the [official website](https://caddyserver.com/download). Depending on how you install Caddy, you may need to set up a service to run it in the background.

2.  Configure Caddy

    A basic Caddy configuration file might look like this:

    ```Caddyfile
    # /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
    liwan.example.com {
        reverse_proxy localhost:9042
        tls you@example.com
    }
    ```

    This configuration tells Caddy to listen for requests on `liwan.example.com`, reverse proxy them to Liwan running on port `9042`,
    and use Let's Encrypt to automatically obtain and renew SSL certificates.

3.  Start Caddy

    Again, depending on your setup, you may need to start Caddy manually or set it up as a service.
    See the [Keep Caddy Running](https://caddyserver.com/docs/running) section of the Caddy documentation for more information.

    Once Caddy is running, you should be able to access Liwan by visiting `https://liwan.example.com`.

</Steps>

## Considerations

Depending on your setup, you might want to configure your firewall to only allow incoming traffic on ports `80` and `443` from the internet, as liwan listens on all interfaces by default.
A simple way to do this on many Linux distributions is using `ufw`, check the [official documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW) for more information.

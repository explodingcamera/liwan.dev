title: Running Liwan as a Service

Liwan can be run as a service on most operating systems. This allows you to start Liwan automatically when your server boots and manage it using the system's service manager.

<Steps>
1.  Creating the service
    To run Liwan as a service using `systemd`, create a new service file in `/etc/systemd/system/liwan.service` with the following content:
    ```ini
    # /etc/systemd/system/liwan.service
    [Unit]
    Description=Liwan Web Analytics
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    # Replace `yourusername` with your username
    ExecStart=/home/yourusername/.local/bin/liwan
    Restart=on-failure
    User=yourusername

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    Replace `yourusername` with your username and adjust the paths to match your setup. The `--config` flag specifies the path to the configuration file.
    To generate a example configuration file, you can run `liwan generate-config`.

2.  Starting the service
    After creating the service file, reload the systemd daemon and start the service:

    ```sh
    # Reload the systemd daemon
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    # Enable the service to start automatically on boot
    sudo systemctl enable liwan
    # Start the service
    sudo systemctl start liwan
    ```

3.  Checking the status
    You can now check the status of the service using `systemctl status liwan` and view the logs using `journalctl -u liwan`.
    If this is the first time you are running Liwan, you can find a link to set up your account in the logs.

## Other Systems

For other init systems, the configuration will be somewhat different, but the general idea is the same. Consult your system's documentation for more information.

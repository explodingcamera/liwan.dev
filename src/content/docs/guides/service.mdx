title: Running Liwan as a Service
---

import { Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Liwan can be run as a service on most operating systems. This allows you to start Liwan automatically when your server boots and manage it using the system's service manager.
Systemd is the most common and is used by most modern Linux distributions. Another popular init system is OpenRC, which is used by Gentoo and Alpine Linux.

<Steps>
1.  **Creating the service**\
    To run Liwan as a service using `systemd`, create a new service file in `/etc/systemd/system/liwan.service` with the following content:
    ```ini
    # /etc/systemd/system/liwan.service
    [Unit]
    Description=Liwan Web Analytics
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    # Replace `yourusername` with your username
    ExecStart=/home/yourusername/.local/bin/liwan
    Restart=on-failure
    User=yourusername

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    Replace `yourusername` with your username and adjust the paths to match your setup.
    To generate a configuration file, you can run `liwan generate-config -o ~/.config/liwan/liwan.config.toml`.

2.  **Starting the service**\
    After creating the service file, reload the systemd daemon and start the service:

    ```sh
    # Reload the systemd daemon
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    # Enable the service to start automatically on boot
    sudo systemctl enable liwan
    # Start the service
    sudo systemctl start liwan
    ```

3.  **Checking the status**\
    You can now check the status of the service using `systemctl status liwan` and view the logs using `journalctl -u liwan`.
    If this is the first time you are running Liwan, you can find a link to set up your account in the logs.

<Steps>

1. **Creating the service**\
   To run Liwan as a service using `OpenRC`, create a new service script in `/etc/init.d/liwan` with the following content:

   ```sh
    #!/sbin/openrc-run

    name="Liwan"
    description="Liwan Web Analytics"

    command_user="yourusername"
    command="/home/${command_user}/.local/bin/liwan"
    command_background=true
    pidfile="/run/${RC_SVCNAME}.pid"
    capabilites="^cap_net_bind_service"
    output_log="/var/log/liwan/liwan.log"
    error_log="/var/log/liwan/liwan.err"

    depend() {
        need net
        after firewall
    }

    start_pre() {
        checkpath --directory --owner $command_user:$command_user --mode 0775 \
                /run/$RC_SVCNAME /var/log/$RC_SVCNAME
    }
   ```

   Replace yourusername with your username and adjust the paths to match your setup. Make sure the script is executable:

   ```sh
   chmod +x /etc/init.d/liwan
   ```

   To generate an example configuration file, you can run `liwan generate-config -o ~/.config/liwan/liwan.config.toml`.

2. **Starting the service**\
   Starting the service
   After creating the service script, add the service to the default runlevel and start it:

   ```sh
   # Add the service to the default runlevel
   rc-update add liwan default
   # Start the service
   rc-service liwan start
   ```

3. **Checking the status**\
   You can now check the status of the service using `rc-service liwan status` and view the logs using `tail -f /var/log/liwan/liwan.log`.
   If this is the first time you are running Liwan, you can find a link to set up your account in the logs.

Installing Liwan using the single binary is the easiest way to get started.
The binary is a self-contained executable that you can run on your server without any additional dependencies.

Currently, Liwan provides pre-built binaries for **Linux (x86_64/ARM64)** and **macOS (ARM64)**. The binary is statically linked using musl libc, so it should work on most (if not all) Linux distributions.

### Installation

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
      **Dowload & Extract the Binary**\
      You can change the installation directory by replacing
      `~/.local/bin` with your desired path.

      <Tabs syncKey="os">
        <TabItem  label="Linux (X86_64)">

        ```sh
        # Download the latest release
        curl -JLO 'https://github.com/explodingcamera/liwan/releases/latest/download/liwan-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz'

        # Ensure the ~/.local/bin directory exists (You might want to add it to your PATH)
        mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

        # Extract the binary
        tar -xzf liwan-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz -C ~/.local/bin liwan

        # Make the binary executable
        chmod +x ~/.local/bin/liwan

        # Run the binary
        liwan --help
        ```

        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Linux (ARM)">

            ```sh
            # Download the latest release
            curl -JLO 'https://github.com/explodingcamera/liwan/releases/latest/download/liwan-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz'

            # Ensure the ~/.local/bin directory exists (You might need to add it to your PATH)
            mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

            # Extract the binary
            tar -xzf liwan-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz -C ~/.local/bin liwan

            # Make the binary executable
            chmod +x ~/.local/bin/liwan

            # Run the binary
            liwan --help
            ```

         </TabItem>
         <TabItem label="macOS (ARM)">

            ```sh
            # Download the latest release
            curl -JLO 'https://github.com/explodingcamera/liwan/releases/latest/download/liwan-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz'

            # Ensure the ~/.local/bin directory exists (You might need to add it to your PATH)
            mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

            # Extract the binary
            tar -xzf liwan-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz -C ~/.local/bin liwan

            # Make the binary executable
            chmod +x ~/.local/bin/liwan

            # Run the binary
            liwan --help
            ```
        </TabItem>
      </Tabs>

      The binary is now installed in `~/.local/bin/liwan`. To run the binary from any directory, you might want to add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH.

      ```sh
      # add this to your .bashrc or .zshrc
      export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
      ```
    </li>
    <li>
      **Run the Binary**\
      You can run the binary directly or install it as a service.

      ```sh
      liwan
      ```

      The first time you run Liwan, it will generate a setup URL. Visit this URL to create your first user account and set up your first project and entity to start collecting data.

      ```plaintext "http://localhost:9042/setup?t=1234567890" "liwan --help"
      It looks like you're running Liwan for the first time!
      You can get started by visiting: http://localhost:9042/setup?t=1234567890
      To see all available commands, run `liwan --help`
      ```
    </li>

    <li>
        **Creating a service to automatically start Liwan (Optional)**

        See the [Running Liwan as a Service](/guides/service) guide for instructions on how to create a service to automatically start Liwan when your server boots.

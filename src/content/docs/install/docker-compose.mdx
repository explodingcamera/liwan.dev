title: Installing Liwan using Docker Compose
---

To download and install Liwan using Docker Compose, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.8"

services:
  liwan:
    image: ghcr.io/explodingcamera/liwan:edge
    container_name: liwan
    ports:
        - "127.0.0.1:9042:9042"
    volumes:
        - liwan-data:/data
    # See https://liwan.dev/reference/configuration for all configuration options
    environment:
        - LIWAN_BASE_URL=https://a.example.com

volumes:
  liwan-data:
```

Then run the following command:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

This will start Liwan and bind it to port 9042 on localhost. To make Liwan accessible from the internet, you will need to set up a reverse proxy. For more information, see the [Setting up a Reverse Proxy](/guides/reverse-proxy) guide.

To view the logs (and find the setup URL), you can run:

```bash title="liwan"
docker compose logs liwan
```

```plaintext "http://localhost:904
It looks like you're running Liwan for the first time!
You can get started by visiting: http://localhost:9042/setup?t=1234567890
To see all available commands, run `liwan --help`
```

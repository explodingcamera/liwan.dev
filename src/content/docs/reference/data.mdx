title: Collected Data
---

Liwan is designed to be privacy-friendly and respects the privacy of your visitors.
It collects only the data that is necessary for generating useful analytics while ensuring that visitors remain anonymous.

## What data does Liwan collect?

Liwan collects the following data:

- **URLs**: The URL of the page that was visited (excluding query parameters and fragments).
- **Referrers**: The URL of the page that referred the visitor to the current page. Only the domain is stored.
- **Browser**: The browser used by the visitor (e.g., Chrome, Firefox). The version is not stored.
- **Operating System**: The operating system used by the visitor (e.g., Windows, macOS). The version is not stored.
- **Device Type**: The type of device used by the visitor (e.g., desktop, mobile).
- **Country** (optional): The country of the visitor based on their IP address.
- **City** (optional): The city of the visitor based on their IP address.
- **Visitor ID**: An anonymized ID that is unique to each visitor. This is used to track unique visitors across multiple visits.

## What data does Liwan NOT collect?

- **IP Addresses**: Liwan does not store IP addresses. Instead, it uses a hash of the IP address to generate the visitor ID. This ensures that visitors remain anonymous.
- **Usernames**: Liwan does not collect usernames or any other personally identifiable information.
- **Cookies**: Liwan does not use cookies to track visitors.
- **Cross-Site Tracking**: Visitors have a unique visitor ID that is specific to each website. This means that visitors are not tracked across different websites.
- **Persistent Identifiers**: Visitors are not tracked across multiple days. Each day is treated as a separate session.

## How are Visitors Identified?

Liwan uses a combination of the visitor's IP address and user agent to generate a unique visitor ID.
This ID is anonymized using a one-way hash function and a unique salt that is rotated daily to ensure that visitors remain anonymous.
The IP is discarded right after generating the visitor ID and never stored on disk.

```python
# Psuedocode for generating the visitor ID
sha3_256(ip, user_agent, daily_salt, entity_id)[0:16]
```
